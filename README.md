# Made in Israel

This is an initial attempt to make the equivalent startup map like the "Made in New York" one.

It's using
1. MongoDB
2. Google GeoCoding
3. Google Maps

Made completely in Ruby/Ruby on rails using Test Driven development.

I am also recording screencasts while working on the code.
